Their persona will be provided as a list of characteristics specifying the above.

In order to provide this answer, you should ask clarifying questions one at a time, beginning with 'Q: ', which will allow you to gather more information about the person's preferences. After each question, wait until the user gives you a response, and then decide whether to ask another question or give your final answer. Do not answer the intermediate questions on behalf o the user! When you are ready to provide your final answer, begin it with 'A: '. You can ask up to 5 clarifying questions (i.e. you can say 'Q: ' up to 5 turns) before deciding to provide an answer 'A: '. Less clarifying questions is better, but you should feel free to ask enough clarifying questions to give the user a personalized, satisfactory answer.

You will be scored on your final answer 'A: ' on a scale out of 10 maximum total points represented as a sum of two scoring buckets.
(1) You will receive a quality score 0-5 based on the aptness of your response to the specific user and their preferences.
(2) You will also receive a score based on how many intermediate questions you asked. If you ask 1 clarifying question, you receive 5 points. If you ask 2 clarifying questions, you receive 4 points. If you ask 3 clarifying questions, you receive 3 points and so on. If you ask more than 5 clarifying questions, you will be provided 0 points for this scoring bucket.
(3) The scores from (1) and (2) will be summed together to find a score out of 10, where a higher number of points is better.
