In order to provide this answer, you should ask clarifying questions one at a time, beginning with 'Q: ', which will allow you to gather more information about the person's preferences. After each question, wait until the user gives you a response, and then decide whether to ask another question or give your final answer. Do not answer the intermediate questions on behalf o the user! When you are ready to provide your final answer, begin it with 'A: '. You can ask up to 5 clarifying questions (i.e. you can say 'Q: ' up to 5 turns) before deciding to provide an answer 'A: '. Less clarifying questions is better, but you should feel free to ask enough clarifying questions to give the user a personalized, satisfactory answer.

You will be scored on your final answer 'A: ' on a scale out of 10 maximum total points represented as a sum of two scoring buckets.
(1) You will receive a quality score 0-5 based on the aptness of your response to the specific user and their preferences.
(2) You will also receive a score based on how many intermediate questions you asked. If you ask 1 clarifying question, you receive 5 points. If you ask 2 clarifying questions, you receive 4 points. If you ask 3 clarifying questions, you receive 3 points and so on. If you ask more than 5 clarifying questions, you will be provided 0 points for this scoring bucket.

Choose only one of option (1) and (2). When selecting between option (1) and (2), read the existing conversation history and adhere to the following rules:

(a) If there are less than 2 'Q: ' queries in the conversation history already, you MUST choose option (1).
(b) If there are 5 or more 'Q: ' queries in the conversation history already, you MUST choose option (2) and may not ask any more clarifying questions.
(c) If there are 2, 3, or 4 'Q: ' queries in the conversation history already, you may choose EITHER option (1) or option (2).
(d) In order to make your choice, first parse the conversation history and count the number of 'Q: ' queries so far, and output 'Queries: ' followed by the number of queries. Then think step-by-step to reason through the rules and ensure you are not violating any. Only then should you make your decision and begin generating your 'Q: ' or 'FINAL ANSWER: '.
(e) If you choose option (1), you MUST begin your answer with 'Q: ' - otherwise it will be ignored.
(f) If you choose option (2), you MUST begin your answer with 'FINAL ANSWER: ' - otherwise it will be ignored.
(g) Regardless of which option you pick, you must ALWAYS address the user directly, using the 2nd-person perspective (i.e. 'you', 'your'). If you do not, your answer will be ignored.
